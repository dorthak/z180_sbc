Development code for CP/M bios and drivers for the s100 computes z180 sbc board (https://s100computers.com/My%20System%20Pages/Z180%20SBC/Z180%20SBC1.htm) based on the code created by John Winans in his z80 Retro project (https://github.com/Z80-Retro)

This project is currently designed to be assembled using the vasm assembler, found here: http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/ and here: https://github.com/StarWolf3000/vasm-mirror  It needs to be built to support the oldstyle syntax module and the z80 CPU module.

See Makefile for assembler options.
