How to use advdis
=================

  For a full dump, change into one of the "adv-B*" directories, and type:

% ../advdis/advdis -t

  The "-t" makes advdis use the provided symbol table ('symbol.tab') and
adjusts output to look more like A-code. The symbol tables were not 
supplied with Adventure; they have been manually generated by me using 
a copy of Dave Platt's ADV550 as a template. 

  If the "-t" is not present, advdis will attempt to name objects by using
the game's built-in vocabulary table and by their descriptions. Since one
or both of these methods may well fail, the object's number is also shown;
the whole surrounded by square brackets.

  To omit certain sections, use:
 -ss  Skip built-in vocabulary/symbol table. 
 -si  Skip INITIAL routines.
 -so  Skip "XOBJECT" routines. These are routines attached to particular
     objects, for which there seems to be no equivalent in ADV550.
 -sl  Skip location-specific (AT) routines.
 -sa  Skip ACTION routines.
 -sp  Skip procedure (LABEL) routines.
 -sr  Skip REPEAT routines.
 -ss  Skip symbol table (vocabulary etc.)
 -st  Skip game text dump.
