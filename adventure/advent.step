******* SOLUTION TO ADVENTURE VERSION B01 ********

               by Calvin T. Richter

     STOP:   This  is  a complete  walkthrough  of 
Adventure Version B01.   As such,  it contains ex-
plicit solutions to the problems and riddles which 
a  player  will encounter therein.   In  order  to 
derive the greatest pleasure from the game,  it is 
reccommended  that  the reader not  consult  these 
notes until he has given sufficient effort of  his 
own to the game.   The greatest satisfaction comes 
from  solving  its many puzzles and riddles  using 
one's  own ingenuity (and luck),  thus looking  up 
the  answer  here should be done only  as  a  last 
resort.

     The original Adventure,  developed in 1970 by 
Crowther  and  Woods for  mainframe  systems,  has 
spawned  and come to symbolize an entire genre  of 
computer gaming.   It has since been released into 
the  public  domain  and,  as is  inevitable  with 
public   domain  software,   has   been   modified 
extensively  and  now  exists  in  many  different 
versions.    These  notes  apply  specifically  to 
Adventure Version B01 by Michael Goetz,  a greatly 
expanded  version of the original.   However,  the 
player of the original,  and indeed  any,  version 
will  find  in  these notes much to  aid  him,  as 
Version   B01   contains  all  of   the   original 
unmodified.
     In Adventure,  the player assumes the role of 
an adventurer whose task it is to explore Colossal 
Cavern,  a  large underground cavern full of trea-
sures  and  magic and inhabitants of  many  kinds.  
The  object  for the adventurer is to  collect  as 
much  of the treasure as possible and to bring  it 
home  while avoiding the many snares  and  dangers 
awaiting  him.   Along  the way he will find  many 
objects  and discover many things which  will  aid 
(and hinder) him in his quest.

     When  Adventure is first brought up,  the as-
piring adventurer is greeted with those now-legen-
dary words: "You are standing at the end of a road 
before  a small brick building.   Around you is  a 
forest.   A small stream flows out of the building 
and down a gulley."  This building,  it will  soon 
be  discovered,  serves as the adventurer's  "home 
base",  wherein  he will deposit all the treasures 
he  discovers.   Scoring in Adventure proceeds  as 
follows: To begin, the adventurer is awarded twen-
ty  points simply for gaining entrance to the  Ca-
vern.   This is done in an effort to  discriminate 
between serious, though perhaps inexperienced, ad-
venturers  and  the obvious rank  amateurs.   Once 
admittance to Colossal Cavern is  gained,  scoring 
continues  on the following basis:  fifteen points 
are awarded for each treasure which the adventurer 
successfully removes from the Cavern and  deposits 
in  the building (though these points will be sub-
tracted again should the treasure ever be  removed 
again).  Sixty-nine  points are awarded upon  suc-
cessful entry into the first part of the end game, 
or Master's Section, twenty for successful comple-
tion of this section, and twenty for completion of 
the final part of the Master's Game.  In addition, 
there  are a few various and sundry  other  points 
awarded,  such  as  awards based on the amount  of 
Cavern explored,  or successfully getting  through 
some of the more harrowing sections.
     In  addition to raw pointage,  the game  will 
also  award  a  ranking,  based on the  number  of 
points achieved, when the player either decides to 
end the game or gets killed.   The rankings run as 
follows:
     0   to 19  pts......rank amateur
     20  to 129  " ......novice-class adventurer
     130 to 239  " ......experienced      "
     240 to 349  " ......seasoned         "
     350 to 469  " ......Junior Master
     470 to 509  " ......Master Adventurer Class C
     510 to 529  " ......Master Adventurer Class B
     530 to 549  " ......Master Adventurer Class A
     550         " ......Adventurer Grandmaster

     The Cavern itself is quite extensive, consis-
ting of many rooms,  tunnels and other  unexplored 
passages,  much  of which a player would never see 
were  he  to  rely upon these notes for  his  sole 
guide.   The  purpose of these notes is simply  to 
lead  the reader in the quickest,  most  efficient 
manner  possible to the treasures and  out  again.  
Thus  the reader is strongly encouraged to explore 
on his own as well,  apart from these  notes.   Of 
most interest to the adventurer in the Cavern are, 
of course,  the treasures.  Of these, it will suf-
fice  to  say at the moment that there are  twenty 
six, as follows:

     A bag filled with pieces of eight
     A massive iridium crown
     A large sparkling nugget of gold
     Diamonds
     Bars of silver
     Precious jelwelry
     Many coins
     The pirate's treasure chest
     A large nest, full of golden eggs
     A jewel-encrusted trident
     A gem-encrusted visorless helmet
     A delicate, precious, ming vase
     An emerald the size of a plover's egg
     A saphire-encrusted sceptre
     The ruby yacht of Omar Khayyam
     A platinum pyramid, 8 inches on a side 
     A glistening pearl
     A persian rug
     Rare spices
     A string of ancient indian turquoise beads
     A golden chain 
     A shiny ring (crafted of the finest mithril)
     A small spyglass carved out of whale baleen
     A crystalline sculpture of a moose
     An ancient chinese jade bracelet
     A casket full of rare opals

In addition to the treasures,  the adventurer will 
discover  a number of other objects which  may  be 
manipulated in one manner or another.   It will be 
discovered  that all,  or nearly so,  of these ob-
jects serve a useful purpose;  it is only left  up 
to  the  adventurer to discover what that  purpose 
is.   More will be said about these objects as the 
game progresses.   Magic also works in the Cavern, 
and  the  adventurer will often  discover  himself 
using it as well to further his progress.
     Finally,  as will be seen,  the Cavern is in-
habited by a wide variety of mythical and  magical 
beasts,  most  of which are there solely  for  the 
purposes of thwarting the adventurer in his quest.  
Thus,  as  part of his adventure,  the player must 
learn how properly to deal with these creatures as 
well.  These Cavern residents will be discussed at 
greater length as they are encountered.



     Having  gotten the preliminaries out  of  the 
way,  then,  it is time to begin the game.  Before 
doing so, however, it will be necessary to offer a 
brief  explanation of the notation employed below.  
The  computer will act as a sort of guide  through 
the Cavern and is instructed by the adventurer  in 
what to do with one- or two-word commands.   Thus, 
for  example,  if the adventurer wishes to proceed 
to  the  south,  he simply gives  the  command  GO 
SOUTH, or SOUTH.  Often I will suggest, usually in 
parentheses and always in capital letters for ease 
of  recognition,  an  exact command which  may  be 
given to achieve a desired result. In addition, in 
a  separate column to the right of the text I will 
summarize  the  commands explained  in  the  text.  
Thus,  the  experienced adventurer may bypass  the 
verbiage  and simply refer to the summary  command 
column.     Thus, the reader might read a sentence 
such as:  "From here, proceed northwest (GO NORTH-
WEST,  or NORTHWEST,  or simply NW)" and, in addi-
tion, see  to the right of the sentence of text  a 
separate "NW".  Finally, as will be seen, on occa-
sion it will be necessary to repeat a command  one 
or   more  times  until  the  desired  effect   is 
achieved.   In  these cases,  the command will  be 
followed  by an ellipsis enclosed in  parentheses.  
Thus,  for example,  "SW(...)" would indicate that 
the  adventurer is to keep trying to go  southwest 
from the current location until he gets through to 
his destination.
     With  these notes in mind then,  let's  begin 
the game.


               THE ADVENTURE BEGINS

     The adventure itself will be subdivided  into 
a series of six excursions into the cavern, during 
each of which the adventurer will collect a number 
of  treasures  and  then return with them  to  the 
building.   Since  the object of the game  is  the 
exploration  of Colossal Cavern,  the first excur-
sion  must necessarily begin with the  gaining  of 
the  entrance to the Cavern.  To facilitate  this, 
you will need a couple of tools.   Enter the buil-     IN
ding  and  look around.   To do this,  type  ENTER 
BUILDING or IN or something similar.  Once you are 
inside the building, you will see several objects: 
a  bottle containing water,  an electric  lantern, 
some  food,  and  a set of keys.   Each  of  these 
objects,  as  will be discovered,  has a  specific 
use, and thus will be needed at some time or other 
in the course of the game.   You cannot,  however, 
take  all  the objects with you now,  as  you  are 
limited  in  the number of items you are  able  to 
carry at any one time.   In fact,  as you will  be 
returning to the building several times during the 
course  of  your adventure,  it will not  even  be 
necessary  to  take everything  now;  those  items 
which  are of no immediate use may be left here to 
be retrieved at a future time.   For the immediate 
future  you will need only the lamp and the  keys, 
so  take these (TAKE LAMP and TAKE  KEYS,  or  GET     GET LAMP, GET KEYS
LANTERN  and GET KEYS,  or something similar  will 
have  the desired effect).  If you have these  two 
items  in hand,  you are ready to begin the  first 
excursion.





                 FIRST EXCURSION

Treasures:  Golden nugget, diamonds, jewelry, rare 
coins,  gem-encrusted  visorless helmet,  bars  of 
silver, platinum pyramid.


     Once you have the keys and the lamp, exit the     OUT
building (EXIT BUILDING,  LEAVE,  EXIT,  OUT, etc, 
will all get you out).  The entrance to the Cavern 
lies  to  the south,  so go south  (GO  SOUTH,  or     S
SOUTH,  or  just  S will do).   The game will  now 
describe  what you see.   Go south a second  time,     S
and  then again a third time.   At this point  you     S
should  see a grate.  Using the keys,  unlock  the     OPEN
grate  (OPEN GRATE,  UNLOCK,  OPEN,  or  something 
similar).   Now  go down,  and you will be in  the     D
Cavern.
     Congratulations,  you're past the first step.  
Wish I could say it's all down hill from here, but 
it's  not.  You now proceed west,  where you  will     W
find a small cage.   Take it,  as it will come  in     GET (cage)
handy shortly.   Going west again, you will disco-     W
ver  that it has become pitch black.   Though  you 
will  from time to time encounter portions of  the 
Cavern  which are lighted,  the majority of it  is 
dark,  making  it  necessary  for you to  carry  a 
source  of  light with you at  nearly  all  times.  
This  is where the lantern begins its  usefulness.  
Turn  it on (ON LAMP,  or ON LANTERN or just  ON).     ON
One  thing must be noted about the lamp,  however: 
it's  battery powered and the batteries  will  not 
last forever.   Thus you are constrained to finish 
your adventure as quickly as possible,  before the 
batteries  run  out.   An adventurer lost  in  the 
Cavern  without  a functioning lantern is  doomed.  
There  does exist within the maze another  set  of 
batteries, but to obtain them it would be necessa-
ry  to  trade away one of the treasures (and  thus 
points),  and  this you will want  to  avoid.   To 
conserve battery power, then, requires that you do 
two things:  first,  all treasures must be removed 
from  the  Cavern  as quickly and  efficiently  as 
possible;  wasted steps must be kept to a minimum.  
And secondly, the lamp must be turned off at every 
opportunity.
     Here,  once  you have the lamp on,  you  will 
discover that you are in a Debris Room,  and  that 
there is a rusty rod lying nearby.   Take the rod;     GET (rod)
it will be of continuing use throughout the adven-
ture.   Now  proceed  west twice.   Here you  will     W, W
discover a small bird. He too will be useful, but, 
as  you  will  have noticed if  you  have  already 
attempted to pick him up,  he proves to be a  very 
elusive object.  The reason for this is that he is 
frightened by the rod,  so you must first drop the     DROP ROD
rod,  then get the bird and then pick the rod back     GET BIRD, GET (rod)
up.  Performing  an inventory now  (INVENTORY,  or 
INVENT for short) will show the bird secure in the 
cage; this is in fact the cage's purpose.  Without 
it  you would not be able to carry the bird,  even 
if you could catch it.
     Now proceed west again, to the top of a small     W
pit, and then go down, to the Hall of Mists.  Keep     D
your eyes open,  because soon, now (usually within 
the  next couple of moves though  occasionally  it 
takes  longer),  you  will  be seeing  your  first 
dwarf.  Dwarves in the Cavern are not very friend-
ly  to Adventurers,  as you will see.   The  first 
dwarf you run across will,  in fact,  throw an axe 
in  your general direction,  but will  fortunately 
miss  (dwarves are notoriously bad  shots).   Once 
this has happened,  be sure to pick up the axe  he 
left behind,  as you will need it to protect your-
self  against  further encounters with  the  crea-
tures.  Until further notice, you will never again 
want to be without this axe within the confines of 
the  Cavern  as  it is almost  your  only  defense 
against  hostile dwarves (there are two exceptions 
to  this  rule,  both of which will  be  discussed 
later).   To  combat a dwarf when he  appears  you 
alternately  throw  the axe and retrieve it  until 
you've killed the dwarf.   When you've  succeeded, 
be sure to pick up the axe again before proceeding 
on.   Note  that you must be careful as the  dwarf 
will  also occasionally throw knives in your gene-
ral direction.  Generally, he misses, but on occa-
sion  he will get lucky and hit you.   (When  this 
happens,  you're dead,  and you are faced with two 
alternatives:  quit the game, or allow yourself to 
be  resurrected.   For the purposes of this  walk-
through,  which include the attempt to garner  all 
of the 550 possible points, it is probably best to 
quit and start over, as you will have lost a point 
for getting killed and will also be forced to find 
your  way back into the Cavern to the point  where 
you were killed, which wastes battery energy which 
is needed to complete the adventure.  On the other 
hand, it may be instructional to continue the game 
from  this point even though it is no longer  pos-
sible  to obtain all possible points.   Should you 
in  fact choose the latter option,  you will  find 
yourself back in the building,  carrying  nothing.  
The  lantern may be found immediately outside  the 
building.  The rest of the items you were carrying 
are presumably at the spot where you expired.)  As 
you  proceed,  then,  through the Cavern,  it will 
occasionally  be necessary to stop and battle  the 
dwarves  that pop up.   These appear  somewhat  at 
random, and I can thus never tell you exactly when 
one  is coming;  the best I can do is to warn  you 
when  one is likely to appear.  You must simply be 
ready for them at all times.
     Now you will proceed to get your first  trea-
sure.   From the Hall of Mists go south, and there     S
it is!   A large,  gold nugget!!   Take it, and go     GET (gold)
north again.  Now, I said earlier that our goal is     N
to  take  all  treasure back to the  building  and 
leave it there.   However,  you'll notice that  if 
you  try to take the nugget back the way you came, 
you  cannot  get  back up to the top of  the  pit.  
Therefore,  you are forced to find a different way 
out.   Of these, there are at least two.  For now, 
just hang on to the gold,  as you will be collect-
ing other treasure along the way before  returning 
to the building,  and besides, it would be a great 
waste  of  steps to return to the  building  every 
time you discover another treasure.
     If  you're  back in the Hall of  Mists,  your 
next  step is to go west again  from  there.   Now     W
you've  come to your first check--a large  fissure 
too big to cross.  Here, however, is where the rod 
makes itself useful; wave it (say WAVE ROD).  Voi-     WAVE ROD
la,  a crystal bridge (pretty neat,  huh?).  Cross     CROSS
it (CROSS,  or WEST or W),  and there, on the west 
bank  of  the fissure is your second  treasure,  a 
collection  of diamonds.   Take them and return to     GET (diamonds), CROSS
the  east bank of the fissure.   From here go east     E
again,  back to the Hall of Mists.   Now, you will 
proceed to the Hall of the Mountain King.   To get 
there  from the Hall of Mists,  either go down  or     D
north (they're one and the same).   Did you find a 
large snake blocking your passage?   Now it's time 
for  Polly to earn his birdseed.   Drop  the  bird     DROP BIRD
(DROP BIRD).   Since you won't be needing the bird 
any longer (this is the only thing he's good for), 
just leave him where he is; as you have no further 
use for the bird,  neither will you be needing the 
cage, so drop it also.  You may also leave the rod     DROP CAGE, DROP ROD
here  for the time being;  it will be used  again, 
but not for a while yet.  
     Go  south.   Here,  in the south side chamber     S
you will find a collection of jewelry.   Take  it,     GET (jewelry)
and go north, and then west.  Now you should be in     N, W
the west side chamber,  where you will find a pile 
of  rare coins (these are the coins which could be 
traded for the extra batteries if  necessary,  but     
it shouldn't be).   Take them, and go east back to     GET (coins), E
the Hall of the Mountain King, and then proceed to 
the northwest.   At the division in the passage go     NW
east  to the dank cubicle,  where you will find  a     E
small mushroom growing on one wall.  EAT the mush-     EAT
room,  and  you  will find that your muscles  have 
bulged "unbelievably".   You now have the strength 
to  not only carry more items at a time  than  you 
could  before,  but also to draw the sword (coming 
up shortly) out of the rock in which it is  embed-
ded.   The  duration  of the mushroom's effect  is 
limited,  wearing off after a while, thus you will 
make  good use of it while it  lasts.  Now  return 
south,  and south again,  to the Hall of the Moun-     S, S
tain King, then go northeast.  Here, in the morion     NE
room,  you  will  find a  gem-encrusted  visorless 
helmet.   Take it, and return south to the Hall of     GET (helmet), S
the  Mountain King.   Now go east to the  Hall  of     E
Mists,  and  east again.   Here you will find  the     E
sword.  Having  eaten the mushroom,  you now  have 
enough  strength to pull the sword from the  rock.  
Take it, and go west and then down (or north) back     GET (sword), W, D
to the Hall of the Mountain King.
     Here  I must pause to discuss another of  the 
Cavern's  residents,  as  it is entirely  possible 
that  he  has made his initial appearance  by  now 
(though  he usually waits until a bit  later,  and 
sometimes until much later).  This is the Cavern's 
very own resident pirate,  whose sole purpose,  it 
seems,  consists in following you around and  pop-
ping  out  at unexpected moments to make off  with 
all  the treasure you've got  (therefore,  if  you 
ever hear any faint rustling noises behind you, be 
wary;  it's the pirate following you).   Sometimes 
(and  this is more likely the case the earlier  it 
occurs), his initial appearance consists simply in 
being  spotted  by  you and  exclaiming  something 
about  needing  to  hide his chest  "deep  in  the 
maze", but often (and always on subsequent appear-
ances),  it  will  simply be his  popping  out  of 
nowhere  to  make  off with the treasure  you  are 
carrying.   If this has happened to you (and if it 
hasn't yet,  it will eventually, be assured) don't 
worry about it.   The treasure is safe and  sound, 
hidden  away  with the pirate's chest waiting  for 
you to come get it.   In any case,  it is not pos-
sible to get the chest until after the pirate  has 
appeared and then "hied" himself off to hide it. 
     From  the  Hall of the Mountain King  now  go 
southwest.   What happened?  More than likely, you     SW(...)
simply  "crawled around in some rocks and ended up 
back  in  the main passage" or something  to  that 
effect.   Here we have encountered another feature 
of the Cavern.   There IS something to the  south-
west  of  the Hall of the Mountain King,  but  you 
usually  don't get there on the first try (if  you 
did  get  there on the first  attempt,  read  this 
anyway, because it won't happen again).  There are 
several  spots like this in the Cavern,  where  it 
pays  to  be persistent.   At such  spots  I  will 
indicate  that  you need to keep trying until  you 
get  through by following the directions  with  an 
ellipsis  enclosed in parentheses.   For  example, 
here I would say "Go southwest(...)".   Now,  keep 
going  southwest until you get through.   I've had 
to do it as many as eighteen times myself  (though 
5  or 6 is normally more than you will  need),  so 
keep trying!  
     When you do get through,  you will find your-
self in an East-West Canyon above a tight  canyon.  
It is possible to go down from here into the other 
canyon, but don't do so yet.  You won't be able to 
get back up,  and will be going that way eventual-
ly,  anyway.   From  the East-West Canyon go west.     W
Did  you find the way blocked by a  large  dragon?  
Your next job is to get rid of the dragon somehow, 
as  you want both the rug he's lying on and a  few 
of  his teeth,  and in any case he's blocking  the 
passage.  To do this, simply kill the dragon (KILL     KILL
DRAGON,  or  KILL).  When asked,  "With your  bare
hands??"  respond "yes",  and there you  are,  one     Y
dead dragon!   Leave the rug for now,  as you will 
need the room to carry other things,  but take his     GET TEETH
teeth.  You  will  collect the rug on one of  your 
subsequent passes through this room.   Return east     E
to  the East-West Canyon,  and then east again  to     E
the Hall of The Mountain King.   Pick up the  bird     GET CAGE
cage here.
     From  the Hall of the Mountain King go north,     N
where you will discover some bars of silver.  Take     GET (silver)
these, and go north again, to the "Y2" Room. Here,     N
turn off the lamp (OFF LAMP),  then drop the cage.     OFF, DROP CAGE
You are again warned about being in the dark,  but 
at  this point that won't concern you.   Here, you 
are  about  to utilize some more of  the  Cavern's 
magic  to  collect one more treasure and  then  to 
exit  back to the building.   Say  PLOVER  (simply     PLOVER
type  PLOVER and press the return key) and observe 
the effect.   You should find that you've >foof<ed 
your way into the Plover room where you will see a 
giant  green emerald the size of a  Plover's  egg.  
Don't take it, however, as this treasure cannot be 
removed  by the way you will be leaving the  room.  
The  treasure you are interested in at the  moment 
lies  to the northeast.   You will return for  the 
emerald  in a later excursion.   For now go north-     NE
east.  Once again, you are in the dark, so turn on     ON
the lamp (ON LAMP).   You are in the Dark Room and 
you  will see a platinum pyramid,  8 inches  on  a 
side.  Take this, return south to the Plover Room,     GET (pyramid), S
and turn off the lamp again.  Now say PLOVER again     OFF, PLOVER
to  pop  back to the "Y2" Room (it will  be  pitch 
black  again),  and the say PLUGH (you may already     PLUGH
have heard a hollow voice say this).   You are now 
back in the building (this is one of the other two 
exits from the Cavern mentioned earlier;  PLUGH is 
a  magic  word which will pop you back  and  forth 
between the building and "Y2").  Here do an inven-
tory  (INVENTORY,  or INVENT for short)  and  drop 
every object you are carrying except the axe,  the     DROP [all but lamp, axe
lamp and the dragon's teeth.                                and teeth]
     One note must be mentioned here.   Though the 
effect  of the mushroom usually lasts much  longer 
than  this,  occasionally it wears off before  you 
can  get to and pick up the platinum pyramid.   If 
this  has  happened,  you will find  that  it  has 
become  impossible to pick up the pyramid  without 
first  dropping  something else you are  carrying.  
Without the effects of  the mushroom you can  only 
carry  seven objects at a time;  with the mushroom 
that limit is increased to twelve.  As you entered 
the Plover Room you were carrying eleven  objects, 
with  room for just one more as long as the  mush-
room  continued.  Thus  if the mushroom wore  off, 
your limit was reduced to seven again,  leaving no 
room for the pyramid.  If that is the case, return 
first  to  the building (using  PLOVER  and  PLUGH 
where appropriate),  drop all your treasure,  then 
return  to pick up the pyramid.   This will result 
in  the taking of a few extra steps but is  accep-
table.
     At  this point you can type SCORE to see what 
progress  you've made.   If everything went  well, 
you  should  have taken between 45 and  50  turns, 
have seven  treasures in the room, and have scored 
129  points  (of course,  if you  encountered  the 
pirate  along the way and lost a few treasures  to 
him you won't have this many).   To see a descrip-
tion  of  the room,  along with the  treasures  it 
contains, say LOOK.



                 SECOND EXCURSION

Treasures:  emerald,  ming vase,  indian turquoise 
beads, persian rug.


     For this next section you will need, in addi-
tion the the lamp and the axe and the  teeth,  the 
bottle  and the water it contains,  so pick it up.     GET BOTTLE
With these four objects in hand,  then,  pop  back     PLUGH
into "Y2", turn on the lamp, and go south twice to     ON, S, S
the Hall of the Mountain King, then southwest(...)     SW(...)
to  the East-West Canyon.   This time go down from     D
here, where you will find yourself in a wide place 
in  a tight north-south canyon,  north to  a  tall     N
east-west canyon,  and then north again, where you     N
will  be  in  a room whose  walls  resemble  swiss 
cheese.    This  room  is  called,   appropriately 
enough, the Swiss Cheese Room.  From here, proceed 
northwest(...)  to  the Oriental Room.   Here  you     NW(...)
will discover an ancient ming vase,  but leave  it 
for now; you will get it on the way back.  Now you 
will  make a brief side trip to drop off the  dra-
gon's  teeth for later use,  and then return  back 
for the next treasure.   From the Oriental Room go 
west  to a large,  low room,  then southwest to  a     W, SW
sloping  corridor,  and finally up where you  will     U
discover  a  bridge  across a large chasm  with  a 
troll  standing  guard demanding you throw  him  a 
treasure  before he will allow you to  pass.   You 
will  not want to cross the bridge just  yet  (and 
besides,  you  are not carrying any treasures with 
which you could pay the toll; and forget any ideas 
you  may have about doing him in to  avoid  paying 
him.   Any  attempt will have "grave" consequences 
for you).   For now,  just drop the teeth here and     DROP TEETH
return back southwest,  down, and southeast to the     SW, D, SE
Oriental Room.   Now, continue on the north to the     N
Misty Cavern, and then west to a small alcove with     W
a tight path leading east.
     From  here  you will want to proceed  to  the 
east,  but the path is so tight that you will soon 
discover  you cannot pass as long as you are  car-
rying anything.   First,  therefore, you must drop     DROP [everything]
everything  you are carrying.   Once you have left 
all  objects  behind (including the  axe  and  the 
lamp),  go  east.   Recognize this place?   You're     E
back at the Plover Room again.   You have  entered 
this  time through the tight passage which you may 
have  noticed  the first time you came  here  from 
"Y2".   This  time  take the  emerald.   You  have     GET (emerald)
returned for the emerald this way because,  unlike 
the platinum pyramid, the emerald cannot be gotten 
out  through  the "Y2" Room.   If you were to  try 
using PLOVER while holding the emerald,  you would 
discover that the treasure remained behind in  the 
Plover Room.   Now,  with the emerald, return west     W
to  the  alcove,  pick up everything  you  dropped     GET [everything]
there,  and  then proceed back northwest and  then     NW
south  to  the Oriental Room.   This time get  the     S, GET (vase)
vase,  and  go southeast back to the Swiss  Cheese     SE
Room.   From here go east and you will find  your-     E
self  in  the Soft Room where you will discover  a 
pillow  on the floor.   Take the  pillow.   Return     GET (pillow)
west to the Swiss Cheese Room.                         W
     Now  go  west to the east end of the Two  Pit     W
Room,  west again to the west end of the room, and     W
down,  where  you  will  discover  a  small  plant     D
murmuring  for water.   Water the plant  with  the     WATER PLANT
water  in your bottle (WATER PLANT or POUR  WATER) 
and stand back!  You should now have a twelve foot 
plant  bellowing loudly for more water.  This  re-
quest  you will fulfill.  Proceed up,  west to the     U, W
Slab Room, up again to a Secret Canyon (from here,     U
if you were to go south,  you would be back at the
canyon  where you found the dragon,  but don't  go 
that  way now),  then north to Mirror  Canyon  and     N
north  again  where you will find yourself on  the     N
southern  edge of a large  underground  reservoir.  
Here,  drop  everything you're carrying except the     DROP [all but lamp and
lamp and the bottle (this includes the axe which I          bottle]
said earlier you never wanted to be without).   Be 
careful,  however,  in doing this, for the vase is 
very  delicate.   In  order to set the  vase  down 
without breaking it you must always drop the  pil-
low first, then the vase, or it will shatter (I've 
done this myself several times and still occasion-
ally  forget).   In that case you've lost the vase 
and might as well get rid of the pillow too.  Fill     FILL BOTTLE
the  bottle  with water from the  Reservoir  (FILL 
BOTTLE  will  do nicely,  as will GET  WATER)  and 
then,  leaving  behind everything else  (that  is, 
taking with you only the bottle and the lamp),  go 
south,  south,  down, south  and down, back to the     S, S, D, S, D
plant.  
     It  must be noted that this being without the 
axe  is  a risky business,  as a  dwarf  can,  and 
frequently does (I think they're just waiting  for 
you to leave the axe,  which several of their late 
compatriots have by now undoubtedly discovered you 
wield  quite  well,   behind  somewhere)  make  an 
appearance shortly.   If and when this happens you 
have a couple of choices.  You may either hightail 
it back to the axe, kill the dwarf (he will follow 
you  back  to the Reservoir),  leave the  axe  and 
continue  on  with what you were doing,  hoping  a 
second  dwarf doesn't appear (I have  occasionally 
encountered  a  second  dwarf  after  killing  the 
first,  and can recall distinctly one occasion  on 
which, after ignoring the first dwarf for a period 
of time,  I found myself confronted by TWO dwarves 
simultaneously!), or you may attempt to ignore the 
dwarf,  waiting until your progress takes you back 
to  the axe and then kill the dwarf.   This latter 
option  is  a bit risky,  as the dwarf  may  start 
throwing  knives  (you will just have to  pray  he 
keeps missing you),  but often,  depending on when 
the  dwarf appears,  is the better option  as  the 
route  back  to the axe is shorter if you  proceed 
forward than if you double back.  If you decide to 
return  to  the axe first,  simply  refer  to  the 
previous paragraph for the route from the plant to 
the Reservoir and back.  Once you have returned to 
the plant, proceed on to the next paragraph.
     There is one other option open to you, should 
you  decide to ignore the dwarf and then begin  to 
feel significantly endangered by his knives, but I 
have  hesitated to mention it as it is very  risky 
indeed.  There exists another magic word which can 
occasionally   be  utilized  to  defend   yourself 
against dwarfs, but it is prone to backfire for no 
apparent  reason and should thus be used only as a 
last resort.   That word is PHUGGG, and be sure to 
pronounce  it carefully.   Two other  restrictions 
apply to the use of this word.   Never, ever, EVER 
use it in the vicinity of water,  and don't use it 
if  you  are carrying  any  sharp  weapons.   Once 
again,  a  word of caution is in order.   I myself 
have  only  used the word four times;  in  two  of 
those instances the results were disastrous.   The 
other times it had the desired effect.
     Once you have returned to the plant, water it     WATER PLANT
again.  Now, go up and east to the east end of the     U, E
Two  Pit Room,  and then down into the  east  pit.     D
Here  you will find a small pool of oil;  take  it     GET OIL
(GET  is  not sufficient here;  you must  say  GET 
OIL).   Go up,  west,  and down back to the plant,     U, W, D
then  climb  up the beanstalk (CLIMB),  where  you     CLIMB
will find yourself in a narrow corridor.   Go west     W
from here to the Giant Room.   Here you will see a 
nest full of golden eggs.  Leave them for now; you 
will return for them later.   Go north,  where you     N
will encounter a large rusty door.   To open  this 
door  you  must first oil the hinges (POUR OIL  or     OIL DOOR
OIL  DOOR).   Once you have done  this,  go  north     N
again.   You will find yourself in a cavern with a 
waterfall,  a whirlpool, and a trident.  Leave the 
trident and jump down into the whirlpool (say JUMP     D
or  DOWN).   The  game will ask "Into  the  whirl-
pool??"   Answer yes.  If you wish to preserve the     Y
bottle,  drop it first,  but if you are being pur-
sued by a dwarf,  you might wish to preserve  time 
and just jump directly into the whirlpool.  If you 
jump  in the whirlpool with the bottle,  you  will 
lose it,  but as it is of no further use,  that is 
of little consequence. 
     You  should find yourself deposited gently on 
the north shore of a large underground  Reservoir, 
with a path proceeding to the north.   This is the 
same  underground Reservoir on the southern  shore 
of which you left all your gear.  (Remember in the 
description  of the southern edge of the Reservoir 
it  mentioned a path across the Reservoir  to  the 
north  which  you couldn't get to?   This is  that 
path.  After staring for months across the  Reser-
voir  wondering how to get to that path,  I disco-
vered this at about three a.m.  one morning when I 
accidently told the game I wanted to go down  from 
the  Waterfall Cavern and it responded with  "Into 
the whirlpool??";   I thought,  "What the heck!  I 
need  to  get to bed,  and it's as good a  way  of 
ending  the  game  as  any."  I was  so  elated  I 
couldn't get to sleep.) If you were being  follow-
ing by a dwarf you will find he did not follow you 
down the whirlpool (dwarves may be dumb,  but they 
aren't  stupid).   Not to  worry,  however.   He's 
waiting  for  you on the south side of the  Reser-
voir.
     If  you jumped into the whirlpool while  car-
rying the bottle you were informed that everything 
you were carrying was pulled from your grasp.  You 
were  able  only to (just barely) hold on  to  the 
lantern.   This is why you left everything on  the 
south shore, so you did not lose it.
     Now,  from  the north shore of the Reservoir,     
proceed  north  along the  path  there,  and  then     N
northeast  into the Witt Company Treasure Chamber.     NE
Here you will find a set of turquoise beads.  Take     GET (beads)
them and return west and then south to the  Reser-     W, S
voir.   See  the gong?   Hit it,  and when  Darwin     HIT
appears,  ride him (RIDE DARWIN,  RIDE TURTLE,  or     RIDE
just  RIDE),  and he will take you back across the 
Reservoir  to  the southern  edge.   Collect  your     GET [everything]
stuff  (if there is a dwarf waiting there for  you 
get the axe first and kill him) and proceed.
     You will now return to the building and leave 
your  treasure,  picking up the persian rug  along 
the way.  To get to the building, go south, south,     S, S
and  south again,  to the dragon and  the  persian     S
rug--pick  up  the  rug--and  then east  and  east     GET (rug), E, E
(back to the Hall of the Mountain King),  and then 
north and north to Y2.   Turn off your  lamp,  pop     N, N, OFF, PLUGH
back  to the building,  and leave there everything     DROP [all but lamp and 
except the axe and the lantern.   If all has  gone          axe]
well  (which  it most likely has not,  the  pirate 
undoubtedly having made at least one, and possibly 
more than one,  appearance),  you should have  now 
eleven  treasures and 189 points,  and have  taken 
between  100  and 110 turns (if you  doubled  back 
after the axe to combat a dwarf,  or otherwise got 
sidetracked,  of  course your total moves will  be 
greater).   By  the way,  if you're trying to find 
out how many moves you've made,  the game is keep-
ing track, but it won't actually tell you how many 
until  you quit.   Neither will it inform  you  of 
your  ranking until the adventure has  ended,  one 
way or another.


                 THIRD EXCURSION

Treasures:  mithril ring,  golden chain,  pirate's 
chest,  and  anything which the pirate  has  taken 
from you.


     This time,  along with the lamp and the  axe,     GET FOOD, GET SWORD
take the food, the sword and the keys and pop back     GET KEYS, PLUGH
to  "Y2".   Turn  on the lantern and go south  and     ON, S
south to the Hall of the Mountain King,  then pick     S
up  the rod,  and you are ready to return  to  the     GET ROD
Giant  Room.   To  get there,  go  southwest(...),     SW(...)
west,  north,  down,  south,  and down,  climb the     W, N, D, S, D, CLIMB
plant,  and go west.  Bypassing the eggs again, go     W
east to a low tunnel and then north where you will     E, N
encounter  a particularly nasty beast,  the  ogre.  
Throw  the  sword at the ogre (THROW  SWORD)  and,     THROW SWORD
when the metamorphosed sword has cooled,  get  the     GET (ring)
ring.  There are a number of rooms and a couple of 
treasures  on  the far side of the door which  the 
ogre  was  blocking,  but you cannot stop  to  get 
those now.  For now, return south and south to the     S, S
Giant  Room,  pick up the eggs,  and go north  and     GET (eggs), N, N
north back to Breathtaking View.  Once again leav-
ing the trident, this time proceed west to the top     W
of   a   steep   incline   and   then   go    down     D
(Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.......     >oof<) to the Large 
Low Room (from here,  southeast would get you back 
to  the  Oriental Room).  Now go southwest to  the     SW
Sloping Corridor,  and then up.   You are now back     U
at  the  Troll Bridge.   If  you were  unfortunate 
enough  to  have the pirate pop out and take  your 
treasure  at any point between the times when  you 
got  the  eggs and when you got to the  bridge  (I 
myself  have only had this happen once,  so it  is 
possible, though rare enough), it will be necessa-
ry to retrieve the eggs from him before proceeding 
on,  as  they  are essential to  you  for  getting 
across  the Troll Bridge.   To retrieve the  eggs, 
return  to  the Giant Room and then  refer  below, 
page 24.
     This  time you do want to cross  the  bridge.  
To  appease  the troll throw him the  golden  eggs 
(THROW  EGGS).   Any  treasure  will  satisfy  the     THROW EGGS 
troll,  but  you  have chosen to use the eggs  for 
reasons  which will become  apparent  later.   Now 
pick  up  the dragon's teeth which you  left  here     GET (teeth)
earlier  and cross the bridge (CROSS or NE),  then     CROSS
go  northeast to a long  east-west  corridor,  and     NE
east to a fork in the path.   From here follow the     E
northeast  fork  to  a junction with  warm  walls.     NE
Once here,  drop the keys and the food,  then pro-     DROP KEYS, DROP FOOD
ceed  to  the east into a chamber  with  boulders,     E
where  you  will find rare  spices.   Collect  the     GET (spices)
spices, return west to the junction where you left     W
the keys and food,  and then go north to Spectacu-     N
lar  View.   This is an underground volcano  which 
you must cross somehow.   It also proved to be one 
of the most difficult riddles for me,  and one  of 
the last to be solved.   Here, once again wave the     WAVE ROD
rod,  and  you will have a lava bridge across  the 
gulf.   Now  drop the rod.   It will prove  useful     DROP ROD
once more before your adventure ends,  but not for 
the  time being.   Having formed the lava  bridge, 
only  half  the riddle has been  solved,  however.  
When I first discovered the bridge I was so elated 
that I went charging right across it,  whereupon I 
was  immediately overcome by fumes and  fell  into 
the volcano.   The secret, which it took me a good 
many  more  months to discover,  is that you  must 
have  the  mithril ring in  your  possession  when 
crossing;  it protects you from the effects of the 
fumes.
     With the ring firmly in hand, then, cross the     CROSS
bridge.    You  will  now  find  yourself  at  the 
southern  end  of a long  valley.   Proceed  again 
north to the northern end of the valley.  Here you     N
will find yourself staring at what appears to be a 
blank  wall.   The  clues to the solution of  this 
riddle are to be found in two rooms located in the 
vicinity of the Hall of the Mountain King to which 
this walk-through does not take you.  The first of 
these  rooms is a dead end which has  the  message 
"Stand  where the statue gazes and use the  proper 
tool" scrawled on one wall.  The other room is the 
Witt   Company  Tool  Room--Melenkurion  Division.  
Here,  you  are standing where the  statue  gazes.  
What tool, then, are you to use?  Well, the "tool" 
is  simply the name of the Tool Room.   Enter  the 
name  of  the Division (MELENKURION) and  suddenly     MELENKURION
you will find three passages in the wall.  
     You will explore each of these three passages 
in turn.   Begin,  however with the passage to the 
northeast, where you will find yourself in a wind-     NE
ing passage which proceeds on to the north.   Fol-
lowing it north,  you will come to a chamber  with     N
golden  walls,  which  has  passages both  to  the 
northwest  and  to  the  northeast.    Go  to  the 
northwest first.   Here,  in the Translucent Room,     NW
you  will discover another treasure,  the  chinese 
jade bracelet.   Take it, and proceed back east to     GET (bracelet), E
the chamber with the golden walls.   Now keep your 
eyes open,  as at any moment you will be  besieged 
by  more of the Cavern's residents-- this time  in 
the form of little eight inch tall goblins.  These
creatures  can  be safely ignored only  for  about 
three  moves,  after which they swarm all over you 
and rip your throat out.   To dispose of the  gob-
lins,  throw  the  dragon's teeth and  watch  what     THROW TEETH
happens.    Having  thus  rid  yourself  of  these 
things,  it is safe to proceed.   From the chamber 
with the golden walls go now northeast.   Here you     NE
will  find a flask.   Take it,  and return  south,     GET (flask), S
south  and  northwest to the northern end  of  the     S, NW
valley.
     This time, go to the northwest, to the south-     NW
ern end of a foggy hall.   Now go north, where you     N
will find yourself lost and bedazzled in the midst 
of  a  strange fog out of which you cannot get  no 
matter  how hard you try.   After wandering around 
in  this fog for a while,  you will be  graciously 
offered a clue for finding your way out, and then, 
should  you accept the offer,  just as  graciously 
charged twenty points for it.   I'll save you  the 
twenty  points.   The clue runs as follows:  "Ok--
what you need to do is apply a little  philosophy.  
To  wit:  there is a question that you need to ask 
whenever you explore a new room in this cave.   In 
most places,  the answer to the question is 'yes'.  
In  some other places,  it's 'no' for  an  obvious 
reason.   Right  here,  the answer is 'no' but the 
reason  isn't so obvious.   If you can figure  out 
what  the  question is,  you can get out  of  here 
easily.   I can tell you this--it's always a vital 
question if you wish to survive."  After  puzzling 
over  this clue for a while,  it dawned on me that 
the  question referred to was "Do I need  to  have 
the  lantern  on  here?"  As the  clue  said,  the 
answer here is 'no',  so turn the lamp  off.   You     OFF
will now see, off in one direction or another (the 
direction  changes  each time you wander into  the 
fog), some light.  Follow that light, and you will     [follow light]
emerge from the fog next to a large  cairn.   Now, 
from the cairn,  go down.  Once again, you will be     D
in the dark,  so turn the lantern back on.   Here,     ON
you  will be in a nondescript chamber,  where  you 
will discover Omar Khayyam's toy yacht.   Take it,     GET (yacht)
and proceed onward to the north.                       N
     Here,  you  will  be in the  Pentagram  Room, 
where  you  will find a pentagram inscribed  on  a 
smooth floor.  Set the flask you picked up earlier     DROP FLASK
in the pentagram (DROP FLASK will do nicely),  and 
then  open it (OPEN FLASK).   The djinn which  was     OPEN FLASK
sealed in the flask will escape,  but will be held 
by  the magical properties of the  pentagram.   If 
you were to open the flask anywhere else the djinn 
would  depart  immediately without giving you  the 
two  clues which you will need  later.   Now,  the 
djinn  is requesting that you open  the  pentagram 
and release him.   Do so, and he will give you the     OPEN PENTAGRAM
first of the two clues, and then depart.  Remember 
this  clue,  as it will not be of use to you until 
after you get to the end game.   So that you  will 
have a copy of it,  I will reproduce it here.  The 
clue  the djinn gives is in the form of a  history 
lesson an runs as follows:  "When Ralph Witt,  the 
architect  and constructor of this cave,  was very 
young,  he became very incensed that his name  was 
at  the  end of the alphabet.   He felt (for  some 
reason) that the letter W belonged near the begin-
ning of the alphabet,  and that all of those  'up-
start  letters  which  unfairly usurped  the  best 
places' should be forced into exile at the end  of 
the  alphabet.   His instinct for matters  magical 
and  mystical led him to apply this strange belief 
into  the cave's structure when he  excavated  it.  
You  haven't yet been affected by his strange  ha-
bits, but you should remember this."
     Having  thus garnered this  clue,  leave  the 
flask where it is and proceed on to the north,  to     N
a  small  crack at the bottom of  a  chimney.   Be 
alert,  as at any moment now the djinn will return 
with  his second bit of information,  and then va-
nish  forever.   This second message describes  in 
detail  the  magic word PHUGGG which  I  explained 
above.  This information is of no use to you while 
you  are on this side of the Troll Bridge  as  you 
will  not encounter any dwarves over here.   It is 
unlikely  that  you will need it after  you  cross 
back  either,  as it is very rare to  encounter  a 
dwarf  again this late in the game (I myself  have 
only  once encountered one at any point after  the 
end of the Second Excursion,  and never,  with the 
one  exception  noted below,  on this side of  the 
Troll Bridge;  in addition,  the Pirate also  will 
never  be seen on this side of the Bridge,  though 
he  will  certainly be seen again once  you  cross 
back over).   You will never in any case run  into 
more  than  five  dwarves in the  course  of  your 
adventure,  and by the time you have progressed to 
the  Troll  Bridge you will normally have  encoun-
tered your limit.  This will not be true, however, 
should  you decide to cross the Troll Bridge  ear-
lier in your adventure.  In any case, from here go 
up to the top of the chimney,  and then go  south,     U, S
where  you will be at the top end of a lava  tube. 
Go  down  the  tube and you will be  back  at  the     D
southern  end of the foggy hall.   From  here,  go 
south  back  to  the  north  end  of  the  valley.     S                 
     You are now ready to begin the final--and  by 
all  acounts  the most interesting--of  the  three 
"mini-excursions"  to  the north of  the  volcano. 
Proceed now to the north, where you will be in the     N
southern  end of a basilisk's  den.   Fortunately, 
the  creature  is sleeping,  but you must be  very 
careful  not to awaken him,  as it's curtains  for 
you if you do.   Very quietly,  then, sneak around 
him to the north (NORTH).   Though you did  manage     N
to  avoid waking the basilisk,  you will see  that 
you  also  disturbed his sleep.   Should you  pass 
this way again,  you will undoubtedly awaken  him.  
You are now in a rough passage to the north of the 
basilisk's den.   From here, go north to a fork in     N
the passage.  Here, drop the axe, as you will need     DROP AXE
the room to carry something else, and then proceed 
down the steps,  and down a second time, where you     D, D
will  come to an exit off the steps to the  north.  
Take  this exit and you will find you are--back at     N
the "Y2" Room!   What a minute.   Or are you?   If 
this is the "Y2" Room,  where's the bird cage  you 
left  here earlier?   As it turns out,  this isn't 
the "Y2" Room,  but a duplicate of it,  thus it is 
called the "Y2"? Room.  Just for fun, and to prove 
this isn't really "Y2", try saying either PLUGH or 
PLOVER.   What happened?   You will find that  you 
are  perched precariously on a ledge two  thousand 
feet above an underground volcano.   This ledge is 
the  one  place where I have encountered  a  dwarf 
(actually  two of them!) on this side of the Troll 
Bridge.   You  might have also,  but  don't  worry 
about them.  To get back to "Y2"? simply say PLUGH 
or PLOVER again.
     From  "Y2"?,  go  west.   You are now in  the     W
Enchanted Catacombs.   Whatever you do, don't move 
until  you have read the rest of this  section  on 
the Catacombs.  The Catacombs are the first of the 
three  mazes which you will traverse in the course 
of  your  adventure.   There are a total  of  four 
mazes in the Cavern,  but the fourth one--the Bat-
tery Maze, where you would be able to get an extra 
set  of batteries for the lantern--it will not  be 
necessary  for the purposes of this  adventure  to 
enter.   Mazes  are hazardous because all parts of 
them  look  exactly like every  other  part,  thus 
making it impossible to distinguish one part  from 
another  and therefore terribly easy to get  lost.  
This  particular maze is especially difficult,  as 
it is possible to go any direction from any  room.  
Thus,  unlike  the Pirate's Maze,  it is not  even 
possible  to  discover  which room you are  in  by 
determining what directions you can and cannot  go 
from it.   If you wish to map out a maze, you must 
first  make each room distinctive so that,  if you 
come  across it again in you wanderings,  you  can 
know  whether you have been there before and  also 
exactly which room it is.   The way to do this  is 
to drop an object in each room you visit.
     Now  that you are in the Enchanted Catacombs, 
what  next?   The  secret to the Catacombs  is  to 
realize that from any given room,  every direction 
leads  you back to the room you just  came  from--
every direction, that is, except the one direction 
which leads you forward.   Thus, you must discover 
the  one direction which leads you forward to your 
goal.   This  rule  applies to every room  in  the 
Catacombs  but one--the one you are currently  in.  
That is,  you cannot get back to "Y2"?  from  here 
once you have entered this room.  You will need to 
find  a  different way out.   You may map out  the 
Catacombs on your own,  if you so desire,  but  as 
this  would take a significant amount of both time 
and battery power,  I suggest doing the following: 
from where you now stand in the first room of  the 
Catacombs  go south,  then southwest,  then north-     S, SW, NW
west,  then  south,  then down,  then  west,  then     S, D, W
northwest, then north, then south, then north, and     NW, N, S, N
finally  east.   If you followed these  directions     E
properly  you will find yourself standing  in  the 
west end of the Audience Hall.  Here, you may turn     OFF
off  the lantern.   From here go east to the  east     E
end of the Hall,  where you will see a throne with 
the  remains  of some strange  creature.   In  the 
creature's  hand  is the jewel-encrusted  sceptre.  
Take it.   When you do, however, listen carefully,     GET (sceptre)
as  the  skeleton will speak  one  brief  sentence 
before crumbling to dust.   The sentence is simply 
this:  "Remember--[word]!"  where [word] is one of 
five possible magic words:  knerl, blerbi, snoeze, 
zorton,  or klaetu.   Which word he speaks changes 
from game to game.   Remember which one it was (it 
may  help  to write it down) as you will  need  it 
twice.
     Once  you  have  gotten the sceptre  and  the 
word,  proceed  back west to the west end  of  the     W
Audience Hall. From here you will need to traverse 
the  Catacombs  once again to get out.   The  path 
back  through the Catacombs runs like  this:  from 
the west end of the Audience Hall go west, turn on     W, ON
the lantern,  then go southwest,  east, southeast,     SW, E, SE
northeast, east, southeast, down, south and north,     NE, E, SE, D, S, N
whereupon you should find yourself back at "Y2"?.
     From "Y2"?  go south back to the stairs,  and     S
then  continue down the stairs,  at the bottom  of     D
which  you will discover in a storage room a  pol-
ished metal plate.  Get it, and then climb back up     GET (plate), U
to the top of the stairs (UP and UP and UP), where     U, U
you  will see the axe which you  dropped  earlier. 
This  time,  follow the fork in the passage to the 
north, and you will find yourself in the Peelgrunt     N
Room.  What the name means (if anything) I have no 
idea,  but  you will find that one entire wall  is 
taken  up by a massive walk-in safe,  the door  to 
which is locked fast.   To open the  safe,  repeat 
the  magic word which you heard from the  skeleton     [word]
on  the throne.   Make sure you use the word which 
the skeleton spoke and not one of the  others,  as 
speaking the wrong one will have disastrous conse-
quences.  Now that the safe is open, enter it, and     IN
you  will discover the massive iridium crown.   Do 
not take it.   Instead, you are going to leave all     DROP [all treasure but
the  treasures you are carrying,  except the  ring          the ring]
(which  you will need to get back across the  lava 
bridge) in the safe.  After you have dropped them, 
exit the safe,  close the door (CLOSE  SAFE),  and     OUT, CLOSE (safe)
proceed  back south,  to the fork in the  passage.     S
Retrieve your axe,  and proceed south again to the     GET (axe), S
rough passage and you will see the basilisk sleep-
ing  fitfully.   You must get by him,  so  proceed 
south  once more.   This time you will awaken  the     S
creature,  but  (assuming you are carrying it)  he 
will  see own reflection in the metal plate  which 
you  are carrying and be instantly turned to  gra-
nite.   You may now discard the plate at any point     DROP PLATE 
you  choose,  as it has served  its  purpose.   Go 
south  again to the north end of the  valley,  and     S
then  south once more to the southern end and  the     S
lava  bridge.   Now,  again with the ring in hand, 
cross  the  bridge (CROSS or SOUTH)  back  to  the     CROSS
south side of the bridge.   Pick up the rod.  From     GET (rod)
here,  proceed  south,  pick  up the keys and  the     S, GET KEYS
food,  then go south,  southeast, south, and east.     GET (food), S, SE, S, E
You  will  discover yourself in the  Barren  Room, 
where  a  bear is chained to the far side  of  the 
wall  with a golden chain.   You want that  chain, 
and  also the bear (believe it or not) but in  his 
current state you couldn't get close enough to the 
bear to unlock him.  Now the food comes in  handy.  
Throw it to the bear (THROW FOOD), who will eat it     THROW FOOD
ravenously  and then tame down considerably.   You 
are  now free to unlock the chain with  the  keys.     UNLOCK 
Take  the chain and the bear (if you say GET  BEAR     GET CHAIN
or  TAKE  BEAR,  the bear will follow  you  around     GET (bear)
until  you say DROP BEAR),  drop the  keys,  which     DROP KEYS
have served their final purpose,  and return west,     W
then west again,  then north,  west, and west once     W, N, W, W
more to the Troll Bridge.  The troll is nowhere to 
be seen.   Now try to cross the bridge.  The troll     CROSS
will  step out of nowhere and block your  way.  As 
you  don't  want to sacrifice another treasure  to 
the troll,  you must find another way to get  back 
over the bridge.   To do this,  drop the bear, and     DROP BEAR
he  will scare away the troll,  who will never  be 
seen by you again.   You are now free to cross the     CROSS
bridge,  but  resist every temptation to take  the 
bear  with  you,  as his weight will collapse  the 
bridge and throw you and him both into the  depths 
of  the  chasm.   Once you have crossed the  Troll 
Bridge,  return to the Swiss Cheese Room by  going 
southwest,  down,  southeast, and southeast again,     SW, D, SE, SE
then  back  to  the Hall of the Mountain  King  by     
going west, west, west, up, south, east and east.      W, W, W, U, S, E, E
     You  are  now ready for the final leg of  the 
Third Excursion,  in which you will finally settle 
your score with that pesky pirate.   If the pirate 
HASN'T appeared by now (I find it hard to believe, 
but anything is possible) your wandering around in 
the  depths  of his own maze carrying  a  load  of 
treasure  will prove a greater temptation than  he 
can  bear  and draw him out of hiding.   From  the 
Hall of the Mountain King first proceed  northwest     NW
and then east,  back to the dank cubicle where you     E
earlier found the mushroom.  By this time you will 
find  that another one has grown there.   Take it,     GET (mushroom)
but do not eat it just yet.  Now go back south and     S
south to the Hall of the Mountain King,  where you     S
are ready to proceed on to the pirate's maze.  You     
have  taken the mushroom because without  it  it's 
possible  that  there is more treasure in the  pi-
rate's maze than you could carry in one trip.   To 
find the pirate's maze from the Hall of the  Moun-
tain  King go west to the West Side Chamber,  then     W 
continue west and then west again.   Here you will     W, W
find yourself at the East End of a Long Hall. From 
here  go east (or up) to the West End of the  Hall     E
of Mists.   To get to the Pirate's Maze from  here 
go  south.   Be certain you are at the West End of     S
the Hall of Mists before going south, not the West 
End of the Long Hall, as going south from the West 
End  of  the Long Hall will also take you  into  a 
maze;  that  maze,  however,  is not the  Pirate's 
Maze,  but the Battery Maze.  Once inside the maze 
be  extremely careful,  as it is very easy to  get 
lost in it.
     Once you have gone south from the West End of 
the  Hall of Mists you are in the  Pirate's  Maze.  
Now  (and be sure to follow these directions  very 
carefully  so you don't get lost) go east,  south,     E, S
south,  south, north, and east.  You should now be     S, S, N, E
standing  on  the brink of a pit  with  an  orange 
column down which you can climb.  At the bottom of 
it is the Bird Chamber, where you originally found 
the bird.  Don't climb down just yet, however; you 
will  do that as soon as you have gotten the trea-
sure from the pirate.   From here proceed east and     E
northwest  and you will find the  pirate's  chest,     NW
along  with  any treasure he has stolen from  you.  
Pick up everything you can.   If you find you have     GET [everything]
a full load before you've taken everything eat the 
mushroom,  then  pick up the rest.  If  you  still 
can't get it all, you will have to leave something 
non-essential  behind  (i.e.  anything except  the 
lamp,  the rod,  the axe and the treasures).  From 
this  point  on,  you will never  see  the  pirate 
again,  as  he goes off to some dark corner of the 
Cavern somewhere to nurse his wounds for the  rest 
of the game. Now return southeast and north to the     SE, N
orange column and go down.                             D
     You  should  now  be in the Bird  Chamber  (a 
"splendid chamber thirty feet high").   From  here 
you  will return to the building to drop off  your 
load  of  treasures  and prepare  for  the  Fourth 
Excursion.   Go  east from the Bird  Chamber,  and     E
then east again,  where you will find yourself  in     E
the Debris Room.  Here you will discover the third 
and  final way back to the building.   You noticed 
the magic word on the wall?   This, if you haven't 
discovered  by now,  does in this room what  PLUGH 
does in "Y2". So, turn off your lamp and repeat it     OFF, XYZZY
now (XYZZY) and-->foof<--you're back in the  buil-
ding.   Now  drop off everything  you're  carrying     DROP [all but lamp and
except the lamp and the axe.  If you so desire you          axe]
may  type SCORE to check your progress  (you  will 
have  at  this point 254 points) and then LOOK  to 
see  a description of the room and all your  trea-
sures.   


                 FOURTH EXCURSION

Treasures:  rare spices,  iridium crown,  sceptre, 
jade bracelet, toy yacht.


     The  Fourth Excursion is by far the  shortest 
of  the  six  (just as the Third was  by  far  the 
longest) and is in fact just a little jaunt in and 
out.   Taking  the lamp,  pop into the "Y2"  Room,     PLUGH
turn on the lantern, go south twice to the Hall of     ON, S, S
the Mountain King and then go down.   You will now     D
find  yourself  in a  large,  high-ceilinged  room 
facing  another door to a massive walk-in safe (at 
least I think it's a different door;  at any rate, 
as you will soon see,  the safe itself is the same 
one  as  you earlier placed  your  treasures  in).  
Here,  once again,  you will need to use the magic 
word  you  got  in the Audience Hall to  open  the 
safe, and once again you must make certain you use 
the correct word to avoid disastrous  consequences 
(on  the other hand,  if you're curious about what 
those consequences might be,  go ahead and use the 
wrong word; I dare ya.).  Once the safe is opened,     [word], IN
enter  it and you will find all the treasures  you 
left there earlier.   Collect them, exit the safe,     GET [all], OUT
close it, and go up, north and north to "Y2", turn     CLOSE (safe), U, N, N
off  the lamp,  and return to the building.   Drop     OFF, PLUGH, DROP [all 
off  everything  except  the  lamp  and  the  axe.          but lamp and axe]
Typing SCORE and LOOK now will show 319 points and 
nineteen  treasures.
   


                 FIFTH EXCURSION

Treasure:  golden eggs,  crystal trident,  cask of 
opals, crystalline sculpture.


     For the Fifth Excursion all you will need  is 
the  lamp and axe.   Return to "Y2",  turn on  the     PLUGH, ON
lamp,  and  you  are ready to return to the  Giant 
Room.   Go south,  then south again to the Hall of     S, S
the Mountain King.   From here,  go northwest  and     NW
then  north,  where you will discover a small vial     N
filled  with an oily liquid.   Take the  vial  and     GET (vial)
return north and south to the Hall of the Mountain     N, S
King. To get to the Giant Room, go southwest(...),     SW(...)
west (there's the dragon's carcass),  north, down,     W, N, D
south and down, climb the plant, and go west.  Now     S, D, CLIMB, W
it  is  time to reclaim the golden eggs  from  the     
troll.  You have noticed the words FEE FIE FOE FOO 
enscribed  on  the wall of the room.   These  were 
undoubtedly  put  there by the  giant  himself  to 
guard  against forgetfulness (giants,  as everyone 
knows,  have notoriously short  memories).  Repeat     FEE
these  words,  but  do so one at a time (that  is,     FIE
type FEE,  press return,  then FIE,  return,  FOE,     FOE
return,  and FOO, return) and the eggs will appear     FOO
back  in the room.   These are the  only  treasure 
that can be reclaimed in this manner, and they can 
be  so  retrieved  from wherever they are  in  the 
Cavern  (or  even from the  building,  I  believe, 
though I have never tried) but you must be in  the 
Giant Room to do so.   This is why it was the eggs 
which you threw to the troll,  and not a different 
treasure.
     Taking  the  eggs,  go north  and  north,  to     GET (eggs), N, N 
Breathtaking View.   This time,  take the trident,     GET (trident)
and  return  south and south,  to the Giant  Room.     S, S
(Note:  if  the trident is now back in  the  buil-
ding--that is,  if the pirate had earlier made off 
with  it and you have retrieved it from his maze--
you may skip this little side trip to Breathtaking 
View.)  By now you should have been informed that, 
despite  the care that has been taken to  preserve 
them,  your batteries are running low. If not, you 
soon  will be.   Our next job will be to  recharge 
them (you could,  of course,  as was suggested, go 
get the other batteries,  but as you will see,  it 
would  be  a wasted trip).   From the  Giant  Room 
proceed east and north,  back to where you earlier     E, N
found  the  ogre,  and then go north  through  the     N
door.  You will now be inside the Sorcerer's Lair, 
where  you will see "NOSIDE SAMOHT"  inscribed  on 
one  of the walls.   From the Sorcerer's Lair pro-
ceed east,  and then east again. Here is where you     E, E 
will  recharge the batteries of your  lamp.   Drop     DROP LAMP
the lamp,  then say NOSIDE SAMOHT,  and there  you     NOSIDE SAMOHT
are.   Note:  be certain you are not holding on to 
the  lamp when you repeat the words,  as the power 
surge would kill you if you were.  WARNING: If you 
have  not yet received a message about  your  bat-
teries  going dim,  DON'T DO THIS yet!   You  will 
destroy  your lamp and to be without a lamp in the 
Cavern is a fate as bad as death.   Wait until you 
are told that your lamp is dim,  and then recharge 
it.  The procedure for doing so (dropping the lamp 
and  then saying NOSIDE SAMOHT) can be  done  suc-
cessfully  at any point before you pass back  into 
the Sorcerer's Lair.  Once you have recharged your 
batteries,  they  will  last sufficiently long  to 
complete  your adventure.   Please note also  that 
this recharging works only once.   You cannot keep 
running  back here every time your  batteries  run 
low.
     Now pick up the lantern and proceed on to the     GET (lamp), NE
northeast and the southeast.   Here you will see a     SE
viscious-looking  growth covering the walls of the 
tunnel through which you wish to  proceed.   Throw     THROW VIAL
the  vial  at it,  and it will wither away to  no-
thing.   Proceed  south through  the  tunnel,  and     S
south  again,  where  you  will find the  cask  of     S
opals.   Take them,  then go north,  north,  west,     GET (opals), N, N, W
southwest,  north,  west and southeast.   Here you     SW, N, W, SE
are in the Ice Room,  at the top of an ice  slide.  
Go  down  the ice slide to the bottom.   Here  you     D
will  find  yourself in the third and  final  maze 
which you must tackle--the Ice Tunnels.   To avoid 
getting lost,  follow these directions very  care-
fully:  go northwest,  west,  south,  west, north,     NW, W, S, W, N
northwest, west, west, south, and south, where you     NW, W, W, S, S
will find the crystalline sculpture.  Get it, then     GET (sculpture)
proceed  north,  north,  northwest,  west,  south,     N, N, NW, W, S
northwest,  northwest,  west, west, and northwest.     NW, NW, W, W, NW
Now you will see a sign which says "This way out".  
To get out of the Ice Tunnels,  say THURB. (If you     THURB
were to map out the Ice Tunnels in their entirety, 
you  would  find  they spelled  out  THURB.)   You 
should now be back in the Ice Room.
     Finally, it is time to return to the building 
with your treasures.   To get there from here,  go 
northwest,   north,  north,  west,  south,  south,     NW, N, N, W, S, S
south,  climb down the plant, go up, west, up, and     S, D, U, W, U
south to the dragon,  and then east,  east,  north     S, E, E, N
and north to "Y2".   Turn off the lamp,  return to     N, OFF, PLUGH
the building,  and drop everything you're carrying     DROP [all but lamp, axe
except the lamp, the axe and the trident.                   and trident]



                 SIXTH EXCURSION

Treasures: pearl, pieces of eight, spyglass.


     There  is one final excursion to make to col-
lect the last of the treasures.  For this you will 
need,  in addition to the lantern and the trident, 
the rod.   Get it, and return to "Y2", turn on the     GET ROD, PLUGH, ON
lamp,  and go south.  This time, rather than going     S
south again to the Hall of the Mountain  King,  go 
down to the Dirty Passage.   From here, go west to     D, W
the  Dusty Rocks Room,  down to Complex  Junction,     D
and  then north to the Shell Room,  where you will     N
discover  a giant clam.   Open the clam (the  clam     OPEN (clam)
can  only be opened with the trident,  that's  why 
you brought it along) and the pearl will fall  out 
(the  clam turns out to be an oyster).   The pearl 
has  rolled away,  so you must go after it to  re-
trieve it.   To do so,  go down and down,  to  the     D, D
cul-de-sac.   Pick  up the pearl and go up and  up     GET (pearl), U, U
back to the Shell Room.   From here, there are but 
two  treasures remaining.   Go up,  then up again,     U, U
and you will see your way proceeds over a patch of 
damp sand.   This is quicksand,  and if you try to 
walk on it you will surely die.   First,  wave the     WAVE ROD
rod,  whereupon you will be informed that  nothing 
obvious  has  happened,  and  then it is  safe  to 
proceed.   Go  east,  to the bend in the  passage,     E
then  north,  to the fork in the  corral  passage,     N
then  north  again to the Fourier  Passage.   From     N
here  go southwest and then down,  to  the  Beach,     SW, D
where you will find a bag containing the pieces of 
eight.   Pick  it  up,  then return up,  west  and     GET (bag), U, W
northwest  to  the fork in  the  corral  passsage.     NW
From  here  go east to the Entrance to  the  Jonah     E
Room  and  then proceed south to the South End  of     S
the  Jonah Room,  where you will find the last  of 
the  treasures,  a spyglass made of whale  baleen.  
Get  the spyglass,  and you are ready to return to     GET (spyglass) 
the building with the last of the treasures.
     From  the  south  end of the  Jonah  Room  go 
north, then west and south back to the fork in the     N, W, S
passage.   Here  you must once again wave the  rod     WAVE ROD
before attempting to cross the quicksand.   Now go 
west,  west and down to the Shell Room,  and  then     W, W, D
south to the Complex Junction.   Now up,  east, up     S, U, E, U
and  north  will complete the trip back  to  "Y2".     N
Turn  off the lamp,  return to the  building,  and     OFF, PLUGH
drop everything you're carrying except the axe and     DROP [all but lamp and
the lamp.                                                   axe]
     Though  you  have  now  discovered  all   the 
treasures  in  the Cavern,  there is yet one  last 
point  to be gained in the Cavern.   With the  axe 
and  lamp in hand,  return to "Y2",  turn  on  the     PLUGH, ON 
lamp,  and go south,  down,  west, down, and east,     S, D, W, D, E
where  you will find yourself in the Anteroom  and 
will  see  several  recent  issues  of  "Spelunker 
Today"  scattered about the floor.  Pick these up,     GET (magazines)
and  the  proceed to the east.   You  are  now  at     E
Witt's End,  aptly named,  as you will see.  Here, 
drop  the  magazines,  whereupon you will  receive     DROP MAGAZINES
that final point (i.e.  you are awarded one  point 
for  dropping  "Spelunker Today" at  Witt's  End).
Now  comes  the hard part--getting out  of  Witt's 
End,  though,  as you will see,  it really doesn't 
matter whether you actually make it out or not; it 
just gives you something to do.
     To  get  out of Witt's End,  you must  simply 
keep trying all directions until you find yourself     N(...) 
back in the Anteroom.   Actually,  you can try any     S(...)
direction   exept  west.    Keep  slugging   away.     E(...)
Sometimes  it can take forty or fifty moves  (make     W(...)
that OFTEN it can take forty or fifty moves).  You     etc.
will,  if  you spend enough time mucking about  in 
Witt's  End,  in all likelihood be asked  at  some 
point  if  you would like a hint to help  you  get 
out.   Don't  take it,  as you will be charged  20 
points for it, and the clue is simply three words: 
Don't  go  west.   As I said,  it  really  doesn't 
matter  whether  you make it out of Witt's End  or 
not,  because  once  you have garnered  this  last 
point  your  sole remaining job consists  in  just 
wandering around the Cavern until the  appropriate 
moment.  If you do get out, pick any direction you 
desire and wander at will.

                   THE END GAME

     It  is time now to proceed to the  End  Game.  
It  has  taken me three years to reach this  part, 
and  much more effort to complete it.  As  already 
mentioned,  your final job will consists simply of 
wandering around the Cavern until you hear a voice     [wander at will]
announce  that  the Cavern will be  closing  soon.  
This usually takes between 30 and 35 moves  (minus 
the  moves  it took you to get into  Witt's  End). 
Once  you hear the voice,  wander around a  little     [more wandering at
longer  (between  10 and 15 moves) until you  hear     will]
the voice announce that the Cavern is closed.   At 
this  point  you  will be transported to  the  End 
Game,  and discover yourself in a small, cylindri-
cal room with a flat floor,  flat ceiling,  and no 
visible exits. In addition, if you type SCORE, you 
will see that you have been awarded 69 points  for 
getting  into  this room,  bringing your total  to 
510.  You will also notice, if you take inventory, 
that you are not carrying anything.   Since  there 
are no manipulable objects in the room, and neith-
er  are you carrying any yourself,  the exit  from 
here cannot be gained in that manner.   Therefore, 
logically, the room must be exited by speaking the 
proper word or words, and the problem then becomes 
to  discover what those words might  be.   Perhaps 
you  have  already tried to use some of the  magic 
words which you picked up in the Cavern, all to no 
avail.   What then is the secret?   The trick here 
is  that  you do not use any of  the  magic  words 
found  in  the Cavern--you use all of  them.   The 
second  half of the puzzle is discovering in  what 
order they must be used.   If you will now  recall 
the  words of the djinn in discussing the peculia-
rities of Ralph Witt,  you will remember that Witt 
had  a fixation with "the last shall be first  and 
the  first  last",  at least when it came  to  the 
alphabetical orders.  The secret then is this: you 
must speak each of the magic words,  but you  must 
do so one at a time (a la FEE FIE FOE FOO) and you 
must speak them in reverse alphabetical order.  If 
you have forgotten,  the magical words,  which are 
seventeen in number,  are,  in alphabetical order, 
as follows:
     
     BLERBI             KNERL              SAMOHT      [speak magic words]
     FEE                MELENKURION        SNOEZE
     FIE                NOSIDE             THURB
     FOE                PHUGGG             XYZZY
     FOO                PLOVER             ZORTON
     KLAETU             PLUGH

Simply enter each of these words,  beginning  with 
ZORTON and proceeding through BLERBI, and you will 
find  that you are--"Standing at the end of a road 
before a small brick building."  This is the  same 
brick building (to my knowledge) wherein you began 
your adventure,  however, if you enter it now, you 
will  discover that it is empty--all the treasures 
and other objects which you placed there are gone. 
Typing SCORE will show that you have been  awarded 
an  additional  20 points for getting out  of  the 
cylindrical  room (in my opinion,  these last  two 
pointage awards should be reversed--20 for getting 
into  the  room and 69 for getting out--for it  is 
much easier to get into it than to get out again).  
A little additional exploration will discover that 
you cannot get back into the cave,  either through 
the grate,  which is locked again (and the keys to 
which  you  do not possess) or through  the  magic 
words,  which no longer work.
    The  answer then to this last riddle  of  your 
quest lies above ground,  and is this:  from where 
you  stand in front of the building go south,  and     S
then  south once more.   You will now be  standing     S
near  a  2-foot slit in the ground into which  all 
the waters of the stream tumble.  You may remember 
seeing this slit when you past it at the beginning 
of the game on your way to the grate, only then it 
was  but 2 inches wide and much too narrow to  fit 
through.  Now it has widened considerably.  It has 
become,  in fact, the entrance to the last portion 
of  the game.   If you had tried going  down  this 
slit  when  you passed it before,  you would  have 
received a response something like "You don't  fit 
through a two-inch slit!"  This time, however, you 
will fit,  so enter the slit,  watch what happens,     ENTER SLIT
and then your adventure is done.  Congratulations.  
All  of adventuredom gives tribute to you,  Adven-
turer Grandmaster!
